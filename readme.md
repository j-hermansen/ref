| Angular | Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. |
| AOT | *Ahead Of Time*. Compiles before (when building app). Not in bundle of the application |
| Azure | Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform |
| cURL | *Client URL*. A computer software project providing a library (libcurl) and command-line tool (curl) for transferring data using various network protocols. |
| Cypress | JavaScript-based front end testing tool built for the modern web |
| Dart | Programming language for client development |
| Go | *Golang*. Open source programming language used for general puppose. Developed by Google |
| Hazelcast | Used for database caching. Hazelcast IMDG stores frequently accessed data in memory across an elastically scalable data grid |
| Hessian | Web service protocol makes web services usable without requiring a large framework |
| ICAP | *Internet Content Adaption Protocol*. HTTP like protocol used to extend transparent proxy-servers. Generally used to implemnet virus scanning and content filters in transparent HTTP proxy caches.
| JBoss     |  Application server |
| JIB | Java tool for building Docker images of Java applications without writing a Dockerfile, no need to install docker | 
| JIT | *Just In Time*. Compiler when running app. Compiler is in the bundle of the application |
| JWT | *JSON Web Token*. For user authentication (Stateless), not stored on the server (compared to Sessions, that are stored on server). JWT therefore do not need to lookup a sessionID in a storage on the server, server only validates signature on the JWT |
| Karma | Test runner for JavaScript that rund on Node.js | 
| Kerberos | A network authentication protocol. Works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner |
| KeyStore | Keystore stores your credential (server or client) |
| Laravel | Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching |
| LDAP | *Lightweight Directory Access Protocol*. Searches a network for something that you do not know the location of. LDAP extracts information in a usable format from Active Directory, which contains attributes behind every user account on the network | 
| Machine Learning | Subfield of artificial intelligence, which enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without being explicitly programmed |
| Magic Bytes | First bytes in a file which is used to recognize a file | 
| Miniconda | Miniconda is essentially an installer for an empty *conda* environment, containing only Conda, its dependencies, and Python |
| OAuth | Used for Authorization. Allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user (using tokens) |
| Observable | Stream of data that you can subscribe to. Type of asynchronious data.
| OIDC | *OpenID Connect*. Authentication protocol which allows to verify user identity when a user is trying to access a protected HTTPs endpoint |
| Pandas | Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language |
| Prometheus | Systems monitoring and alerting toolkit |
| RBAC     |  Role-based access control |
| Reactive programming | Programming with asynchronous data streams |
| Redis | In-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker |
| Rust | Low-level Programming language with direct access to hardware and memory |
| SAML | *Security Assertion Markup Language*. Passing information about users, logins, and attributes between the identity provider and service providers.
| Scala | Programming language that is running on JVM and used in Data processing, distributed computing, and web development. |
| Sessions | For user authentication (Stateful), stored on the server (compared to JWT, that are not stored on server). |
| Solr | *Searching On Lucene w/ Replication*. Search platform written in Java. Its major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. |
| Travis CI | Continious integration service used to build and test software projects hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket |
| Truststore | Stores certificates from Certified Authorities (CA) |
| TSLint | Static analysis tool that checks typescript code |
| WebFlux | Reactive programming used in Spring |
| Webpack | Module bundler. Generate large file(s) from a lot of smaller files. Improve efficiency and load time |
| Windows Registry | Stores much of the information and settings for software programs, hardware devices, user preferences, and operating-system configurations |
| Yeoman | Uses many different tools and interfaces coordinated for optimized project generation, called scaffolding (quickly set up skeleton for an app) |
| Zuul | Edge service that proxies requests to multiple backing services |
