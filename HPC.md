# High Performance Computing (HPC)

## What is High Performance Computing?
HPC is a lot like regular everyday computing only on a much more powerful scale. 
It takes advantage of multiple computers and storage devices to process large amounts of data.
HPC makes it possible to do research on big problems in fields like science, engineering, and business.

## HPC Performance
Performance in HPC systems is usually measured in **FLOPS** (Floating point operations per second).

## Serial vs. Parallel execution
**Serial** - executes one task at a time\
**Parallel** - executes multiple tasks at a time
